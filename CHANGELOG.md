## [Unreleased]

Nothing released yet. The first release (`2026.0.0`) will ship the initial public surface:

- The **Tucker tensor train (T3) format** — arithmetic with dense-tensor semantics,
  orthogonalization, minimal ranks, T3-SVD, save/load, batching on every operation.
- The three **sampling operations** (`entries` / `apply` / `probe`), their symmetric
  directional derivatives, and the ambient/corewise/tangent transposes.
- The **fixed-rank T3 manifold**: orthogonal frame + gauged variations, tangent vectors,
  gauge projections, retraction, and the `MANIFOLD` / `COREWISE` geometries.
- **Least-squares fitting** from any sampling operation or its derivatives (Gauss-Newton
  models) with four optimizers (`gradient_descent`, `mc_sgd`, `adam`, `newton_cg`).
- The **uniform layer**: supercores + boolean rank masks mirroring the whole stack, for
  `jax.lax.scan` vectorization and compile-once `jit` (optimizers included).
- **NumPy / JAX** backends with dispatch inferred from input array types; **safe mode**
  for numerical-precondition checking.
