# T3Toolbox — current handoff

_Updated 2026-07-12 (evening). Prior history: `dev/archive/handoff_2026-07-12_1.0_complete.md`
(the 1.0 completion: R1–R7, the R4 doc pass, the docs user/dev split S1–S5, the cordon/ETT/
literature morning)._

## Where we are — 2026.0.0 SHIPPED ✅

**2026.0.0 is live on PyPI (2026-07-13) — `pip install t3toolbox`** (+ the `[jax]` extra).
REL-1 → REL-4 all done; the full release history is archived at
`dev/archive/release_plan_2026-07-13.md`. The ship (REL-4): CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` →
`[2026.0.0]`; install recipe flipped to `pip install t3toolbox`; gates green (593 tests /
40,215 subtests, docs `-W`, doctests, wheel + `twine check` + fresh-venv numpy-only smoke); commit
`21f7b6fb`, tag `v2026.0.0` → the trusted-publishing workflow (approved on the `pypi` environment)
→ published. **Verified against real PyPI**: numpy-only and `[jax]` fresh-venv installs, quickstart
smoke, and the full `getting_started.rst` doctest (64/64) against the installed package.

Loose ends: the **GitHub Release** for `v2026.0.0` — Nick to create via the web UI (notes = the
CHANGELOG `[2026.0.0]` section); **Zenodo DOI** still deferred (Nick, later); the dead `gh-pages`
branch can be deleted (optional).

## Active threads

- **The toolbox reference paper** (independent): scope + curation in `dev/paper_scope.md`.
  Next: walk the groups starting at Group 6 (`docs/symmetric_probe_derivatives.tex` is nearly a
  drop-in chapter). Paper-grade material queued there from the archive sweep: the two-spaces
  geometry picture; the apply/entries sweep-level scatter derivations.

## Backlog (not scheduled)

- **Default-path doctest pass** for undocumented public functions (Nick wants this).
- **`core_shapes` (property, strips stack) vs `get_core_shapes` (static, includes stack)**
  inconsistency — verified live 2026-07-12; a code decision for Nick.
- **Zenodo DOI** — Nick, at a later date.
- Delete the dead `gh-pages` branch (optional; Pages deploys from artifacts now).
- Per-test seeding → `pytest -n auto`; trimming `test_dispatch` jit time (deferred niceties).

## Post-1.0 (1.1) threads

- The Goal-1 **`fit(...)` facade** (auto geometry/optimizer/ranks/`x0` + rank continuation —
  "standard user, no fiddling").
- **Weighted-layer revival/redesign** (currently parked + cordoned with warnings).

## Standing constraints

The durable rules live where they belong: project-wide conventions and gotchas in **CLAUDE.md**;
contributor-facing conventions and decision records in the rendered **Contributor guide**
(`docs/contributor/` — naming rules, refactoring methodology, testing strategy, the
deferred/rejected ledger). Two operational ones worth repeating here: the docs build must stay
at **zero warnings** (`sphinx -W` in CI), and doctest outputs are **run-and-pasted, never
hand-written**.
